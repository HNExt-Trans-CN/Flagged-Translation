The Crash happened in mid-2017. One day devices just suddenly couldn't connect to websites over DNS. People keep blaming it on a hacker, some say it was a move by the government to construct the Network. Nobody really knows the true story.

>DNS
What?
------------------------------------------
dns was a super old way to connect to shit on the internet without an "ip". basically think of how ezdresses resolve nids nowadays.

Oh, I see. Man, this isn't the stuff they teach you in school.
