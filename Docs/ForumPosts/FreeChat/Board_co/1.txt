What's the best place to get comics at these days?

On the network? Nowhere

There used to be places like MylarTown which were distributing torrent comics in epub or pdf form, but I don't think they exist anymore. MNC said there was a server outage then they never came back online.

You can get them from torrents if you're fine taking that route. Somewhere like b4b or hexic probably has a limited selection of them.

>hexic

>b4b
b4b went down a bit ago, anon. can't get stuff from there anymore.
