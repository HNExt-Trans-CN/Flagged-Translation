Hey, I've got a big problem. Recently I grabbed a copy of Terrasplore, and after installing it, my computer forced a reboot and all my files were encrypted by some shitty ransomware.

I'll send my new NID after I get this new box fixed up.

aight, i'll bite. get us a memdump if you can.
------------------------------------------
Good luck, OP! Interested in seeing what strain this is.
