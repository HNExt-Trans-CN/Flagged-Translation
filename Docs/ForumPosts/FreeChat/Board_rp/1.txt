#Snake
Anybody want to start a game of Snakewars? I've got character sheets
------------------------------------------
>Snakewars
Game has literally no opportunities for scenarios. It's boring as fuck.
------------------------------------------
Aww come on, it'll be fun!
------------------------------------------
anon, there's literally 1 scenario that was ever made for the game, about clubbing snakes to death before they consume the white house. all of the rulebook is built around this specific scenario. nobody wants to play it.
------------------------------------------
And when was the last time you played?
------------------------------------------
15 years ago. Was enough for me then and it's enough for me now.
