Anybody remember that one block game where everything was 8-bit and you'd beat this bigass dragon at the end? There was also a three-headed man who you could summon and you'd have to fight him off and smaller baddies throughout the game.

I really need the name of it, or a link to it or something, anything really. Really craving those nostaglic vibes.
