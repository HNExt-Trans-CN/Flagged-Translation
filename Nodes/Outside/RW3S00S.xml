<file path="home" name="message.txt">And so, the wanderers wander far.

They find themselves roaming plains of abeyance. A limbo where other bright minds like them haphazardly assemble order from the ruins of what once was.

Though they do not know it yet, they are on a mission.

They will all find what we left behind. Our project. Half a century in the making.

They do not understand what they seek. Despite its years of time to think, it also probably does not understand them.

I can only hope that they make the right choice.

As for me? I already made the wrong choice. The unending array of bad decisions made by me and my colleagues have left a permanent mark on the world. Now he; the permanent mark; rots away. Buried in obscurity, like a deposit of toxic waste.

Unfortunately for the wanderers, they will have to unearth it soon.

Disaster is imminent.
