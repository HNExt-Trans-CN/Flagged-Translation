  <posting title="Firewalls">Firewalls act as an intrusion prevention system in modern computer systems. While active, a firewall solution will need to be provided before an unsyndicated login attempt can be attempted - effectively meaning that software designed to bruteforce passwords remotely will be useless while the firewall is active.

Firewalls typically serve to prevent automated foreign network traffic rather than secure against dedicated hackers, due to the ease at which a human attacker can syndicate with the firewall.

Operators can examine firewall complexity with the "analyze" command - running the analyze command multiple times will automatically detect patterns in the response data headers and will eliminate characters it can guarantee are not a part of the correct firewall solution.

Once a potential solution is found, the command "solve [FIREWALL_SOLUTION]" can be used to attempt to syndicate.

Unlike proxies, firewalls prevent the execution of the PortHack exploitation program.
