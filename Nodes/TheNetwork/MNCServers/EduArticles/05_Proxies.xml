  <posting title="Proxies">In the computing world, there are times where you simply don't want people to see the origin of a remote server. You may think that the server is under risk of hacking attacks or perhaps you just want to conceal yourself a little. Proxies are designed to act as a "barrier" of sorts between the real host and the outside world. Communications over most ports are passed through the proxy server while it is active. This has the side-effect of causing most contemporary hacking tools to fail due to inconsistencies in the connection.

This doesn't mean proxies are without their flaws however. Certain protocols are unable to use proxies, such as the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol, and as such they are potentially exploitable while a proxy is active.

Most proxies also lack proper failsafes for bandwidth saturation, meaning a large amount of connections to a host at once will exceed most commercially-available Network bandwidth packages, rendering the proxy inoperable, allowing unfiltered traffic to pass through. An attacker controlling a large amount of remote shells (using the built-in "shell" remote administration tool on most Netizen OS lines) can overload proxies with ease. Especially weak proxies can potentially crumble at just a single or two hostile nodes.

It is also worth noting that proxies do not prevent the execution of the PortHack program provided to Operators.
