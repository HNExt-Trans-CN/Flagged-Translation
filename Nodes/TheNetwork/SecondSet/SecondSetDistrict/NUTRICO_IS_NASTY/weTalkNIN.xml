    <post user="raynestorm">hey uh, listen rene, i have something important to discuss</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">wassup?</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">so i think what we have so far is a pretty good start</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">but people aren't really... doing anything about it</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">I saw some posts on FreeChat and people seem to at least agree with the message</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">right, which is good and all</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">but we haven't really gotten anybody to "act" yet know?</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">Act in what way?</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">I'm not going to be condoning violence, for the record</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">people are just sitting there, taking in the message contently, but doing nothing about it</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">I'm considering getting some outreach, starting by pulling in the hacker community to our cause</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">?</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">they can start by monitoring our IS logs or whatever</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">but eveneutally i'm getting a hacker to vandalise their webpage</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">:/</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">Not down for this. You better watch your step maureen</post>
    <post user="z_b_d">Bringing in the "hacker" community, if that's even left, is going to kill our optics. Nobody likes them post-crash, after all</post>
    <post user="raynestorm">whatever you say rene. i want some goddamn action here.</post>
