IMPORTANT: By default, TFW (Theta Firewall) will not accept any external connections except for SSH and FTP. If you want to allow traffic to a particular port, try `sudo tfw allow inbound $PORT`. In addition, the default firewall solution of "theta" has been set. You should change this at your earliest convenience.
