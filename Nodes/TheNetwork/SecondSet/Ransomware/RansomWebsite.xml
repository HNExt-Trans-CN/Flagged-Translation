You can now further configure the machine to your liking. If you have any questions, feel free to check out our support page and community forums.
Please remember that administrative access is currently only whitelisted for the NID(s) you have specified in your account settings.

IMPORTANT: By default, TFW (Theta Firewall) will not accept any external connections except for SSH and FTP. If you want to allow traffic to a particular port, try `sudo tfw allow inbound $PORT`. In addition, the default firewall solution of "theta" has been set. You should change this at your earliest convenience.

Happy shenanigans,
