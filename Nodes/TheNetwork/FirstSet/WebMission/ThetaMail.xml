    <email recipient="contact" sender="HeySiri" subject="webbuilder wizard broken?">i was trying to make a webpage today with your page builder but i dont think its working right now?

it keeps trying to load in "theta_stats.dll" onto the page but that's not on my rackspace at the moment. i recently installed a mail server, an antivirus toolkit and some plugins if that helps, i'm sure you can check the logs or something.

thank you very much for your time</email>

    <email recipient="contact" sender="jipotte" subject="Silver plans?">Hey,

What happened to your silver plans? They were such a good in-between for bronze and gold but now you've just entirely removed it from the site.

Do you have an ETA for when they will return, if ever?

Thanks</email>

IT KEEPS TELLING ME THAT I NEED TO USE A "PUBLIC KEY" TO LOG IN TO MY COMPUTER. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THIS IS VERY ANNOYING AND I WANT TO HAVE MY OLD LOGIN PASSWORD BACK.

VERY UPSET. EXPECT A REFUND REQUEST IF THIS EMAIL IS NOT ANSWERED IN A TIMELY MANNER.</email>
