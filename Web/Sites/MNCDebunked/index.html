			<h1>Why is the MNC so ineffective?</h1>

			<p>As you probably already know, MNC has, lightly speaking, a reputation among netizens for their lack of competence. They're essentially picking total randos out of the network to jump around and run their script-kiddy-tier tools on people's <b>OWN</b> computers, leaving behind all sorts of mess, <b>PROVING</b> that they know of unpatched exploits on The Network, then refraining from fixing them because of sweet, sweet backdoor access and finally expecting said random weirdos to do exactly as they are told!</p>

			<h2>Reason #1: People are stupid.</h2>
			<p>People aren't the brightest, especially those with power to enter anyone's PC without warning. The Operators can and probably WILL do stupid shit like removing every single file off of people's computers - and then the MNC will be held responsible. Or not. It's a government agency, after all. They'll flood the dispatch with all kinds of invalid bullshit and alienate people in need of actual, legitimate help from them.</p>

			<h2>Reason #2: The Operators are stupid.</h2>
			<p>Their recruitment consists of almost nothing but fresh-faced kids who know absolutely <b>nothing</b> about cybersecurity! They have to lecture them on what proxies and firewalls are in their stupid "networking archive", which is also filled to the brim with misinformation, but that's another story entirely. What the hell?! Are the higher-ups at MNC expecting that these people can keep The Network safe and secure? I honestly doubt that.</p>

			<h2>Reason #3: <i>What</i> are the Operators even working for?</h2>
			<p>If you guessed "money", ding ding, you're completely wrong! <b>They don't even get paid.</b> Do they just expect people to work such a critical job for headpats? Exposure? No one, even including the idiots they hire for the program can be <i>that</i> stupid!</p>

			<h2>Reason #4: Why do we need such people in the first place?</h2>
			<p>Some people might not get it, but those in the know understand what this is all about. Michael Powell, the head of MNC, is just stalling so that <span id="removed">[NETIZEN OS - CONTENT AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED]</span> and everyone's kicked off eventually.</p>
