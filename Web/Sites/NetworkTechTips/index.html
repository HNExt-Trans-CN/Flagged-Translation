			<h1>NETWORK TECH TIPS</h1>

			<p>With your friend GuruDaniel, navigating the Network is so much easier!</p>

			<h2>Password Security</h2>
			<p>Weak passwords are the number-one reason why people's private data falls into the wrong hands. You need to pick stronger passwords! Here's my guide, use data that only YOU can know! Your place of birth, your favorite hobby and your birth year. So say if you were born in Ottawa, your favorite hobby is computers (hey, mine too :P) and you were born in 2005. "OttawaComputers2005" -- Long! Hard to guess! Hard to bruteforce! UNHACKABLE!</p>

			<h2>Program Performance</h2>
			<p>There are some <i>slooooow</i> programs out there. Once they're finished with whatever task they're up to, they'll hang around eating up precious RAM for no reason at all! Using the <b>ps</b> command, you can list the process IDs of every running process and use <b>kill [ID]</b> to end the process earlier than usual, saving you precious RAM and time!</p>
