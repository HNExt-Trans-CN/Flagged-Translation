Hi!

If you're reading this text file, you're probably either curious as to how this extension works internally or, likely, you're stuck on a puzzle and want solutions.

I don't mind datamining as a concept and I admit that I do it all the time; however, I would like to ask that you respect the time and effort that goes into designing extensions and the puzzles within them.

Inside these folders is spoilers galore. Feel free to datamine it (after all, I can't reasonably stop you either way), but I'd at least like to ask that you do not publicly share anything you uncover in here until the puzzles are solved legitimately.

Thanks
