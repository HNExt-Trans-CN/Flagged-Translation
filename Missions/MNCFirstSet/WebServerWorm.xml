    <body>Thank you for your continued interest in the Operator program.

Our automated scraping system has flagged a suspicious website which requires manual investigation.

Your task will be to erase any misinformation about the MNC or information that violates the operational security of the Operator program from the website by replacing it with alternative content. For further information, please refer to the included note.

In order to replace the contents of files, you must have write permissions on the node containing the file (which often requires administrative rights) -- from there, the "replace" command can be used. Provide the file name, a target string (quotes can be used for strings with spaces) and the string to replace it with.

To accomplish your task, you will be given access to the WebServerWorm tool capable of exploiting a variety of vulnerabilities in all common HTTP servers.

Good luck, Operator!
