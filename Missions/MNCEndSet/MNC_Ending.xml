    <subject>Incredible work!</subject>
    <body>Congratulations, Operator!

You did an incredible job detaining the hacker. He will worry the citizens of The Network no longer! Heh...

Anyway, you did a fantastic job and we want to recognise your achievements and willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty. As such we have prepared two gifts for you.

You now have PRIORITISED ROUTING across the network, for both your work terminal and leisure devices! No longer shall you be slowed down by your bandwidth package for civilian activities!

Secondly, we have provided you access to the "DNotes" tool on the Asset Server. DNotes stands for DETECTIVENotes and will be extremely useful if you intend to do a lot of writing in any other cases I'm sure you're ready to bust later down the line!

I hope you enjoy these gifts as much as we have enjoyed your service; now go take a break buddy. You've earned it.

- M. Powell, director of the Municipal Network Committee
