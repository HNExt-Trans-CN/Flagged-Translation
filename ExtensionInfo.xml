  <WorkshopDescription>[h1]Greetings, Operator![/h1]

You have been selected by the Municipal Network Committee to participate in its exclusive Operator program! Thanks to vigilant citizens such as yourself, we can ensure that The Network remains a safe place for all. These virtual streets won't police themselves!

--

@ Tap into the secret lives of the denizens of The Network!
@ Prove yourself as a valuable Operator!
@ Obtain powerful tools!
# liberate yourself
# correct mistakes

--

An extension produced as a collaboration between Matrix, A Casual Guy and Hertz for #Hackerjam2!
Featuring a musical score (and some x-server backgrounds) by the mysterious and wonderful Snacks and Tukib!

~~~
This mod is currently in a demo state due to the deadline imposed by the HackerJam. While there is still plenty of content to enjoy from it already, at some point you will have to create a new save file when the mod is fully complete. Apologies in advance, but we hope you enjoy the extension regardless!

  <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
